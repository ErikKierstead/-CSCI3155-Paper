Topic:
======

Why the subprocess module in Python was a necessary and accepted PEP over previous implementations of sys.os and similar methods.  What functionality they failed to provide, security risks, and the philosophy of further pushing Python as a scripting language.  I am keeping it pretty loose for the moment.

Background:
===========

I have experience with the subprocess module and have used it extensively in scripting.  I have always wanted to greater master its use, especially after learning more about processes in Comp Systems, and this seems like as good an opportunity as any.
